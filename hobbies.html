<h1>Hobbies &amp; Interests</h1>
<p>I am constantly tinkering around with computers and doing various projects with them (such as making a podcast generation
software written in Python,
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/AtlasJan/pcc">PCC</a>, it's still a work-in-progress, though), I am also attempting a project of an
incredibly large scale, (out of my own spare time)
a Tolkienesque fantasy world that will have every detail present; and which anyone can use to contribute to, or use as a setting
for a potential work.</p>
<p>I’ve been particularly interested in how the mind works, as well as a passing interest in Astrology, I’m a Scorpio, take what
you will from it.</p>
