<h1>About</h1>
<p>An aspirational, young, soul new to the world of work.
I'm is quick to get my ideas out and share them with the rest of the world.
I'd say that I'm also also quite a tinkerer primarily with Unix-based computers, often
attempting to automate more complex tasks of production in order to make it
easier for himself.</p>
